    <p>
      During my time as the Head of Cultural Events at my university, I led a special initiative aimed at supporting students who had recently failed a subject. Understanding the emotional toll it can take on students in their first and second years, I organized a motivational session with one of our distinguished alumni who had once faced the same challenge—and overcame it.

    <p>
      The purpose was to show these students that setbacks are part of the journey—not the end of it. The alumnus shared their own story of failure, growth, and eventual success, which deeply resonated with attendees. This helped shift many students' mindsets, showing them that with determination and the right guidance, they could absolutely bounce back.

    <h2 id="execution">Planning & Execution</h2>
    <p>
      I personally coordinated with university staff, the alumnus speaker, and students to make this event happen. From securing the venue and organizing logistics to publicizing the event and ensuring it reached the right audience, every aspect was handled with care. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with many attendees sharing how the session gave them hope, motivation, and a clear path forward.
