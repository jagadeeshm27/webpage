    <h2 id="summary">Project Summary</h2>
    <p>
      As the Head of the White Hat Club during 2020 and 2021, I was passionate about empowering students with practical knowledge about cybersecurity, internet culture, and trending technologies. I led weekly sessions where I introduced students to ethical hacking concepts, digital safety, and modern tools used in real-world applications.

    <div class="role-name">Jagadheesh Muthamsetty</div>
    <p>
      I taught the fundamentals of Kali Linux, network scanning techniques, types of cyber threats, and how to defend against them. Beyond cybersecurity, I helped students understand the basics of YouTube monetization, website creation, video equipment, and the role of the internet in creative professions. These sessions aimed to blend technical know-how with real-world applications to inspire and guide aspiring technologists.

    <h2 id="impact">Impact & Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      These sessions had a lasting impact. Many first-year and second-year students gained clarity on career paths, learned how trending technologies like IoT, ethical hacking, and web development could shape their futures, and even started their own creative or technical projects. By demystifying complex tools and ideas, the club created a community of curious and confident learners.
